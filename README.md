# Robotpy Templates
A small collection of **python** repositories that you can use to quickly test, or add to, when starting a project. Make sure you are using the right robotpy versions

## Drive Train
The drive train robot is the most basic kind and is a good starting point for beginners in robotpy as it includes some basic commands and subsystems that can explain how the robot works (somewhat), 

To install the proper robotpy packages for this robot, refer to the [robotpy installer guides](<https://github.com/AltaHighRobotics/RobotpyInstallers.git>)

## Swerve Bot
The swerve bot includes motors that will rotate the wheels of the robot so that it can position itself without needing to turn its frame

## Tank Bot
**We do not have a template for this robot yet**

___
## Use
Download the zip, **extract the folder** and then enter the `/robot` folder within your downloaded robot folder. You can use either vscode's built-in terminal or your system terminal to test it out by running:
```python
robotpy test
```
OR
```python
python3 -m robotpy test
```
After you confirm that the template works with the tests, you can go ahead and use the sample code that is either commented out or in the notes

## WIP
Adding options for virtual environment installation, adding tank bot (will come much later)
